**Abstract:**   
This paper presents a nonlinear mathematical model of the glucose-insulin
feedback system, which has been extended to incorporate the beta-cells'
function on maintaining and regulating plasma insulin level in man. Initially,
a gastrointestinal absorption term for glucose is utilized to effect the
glucose absorption by the intestine and the subsequent release of glucose into
the bloodstream, taking place at a given initial rate and falling off
exponentially with time. An analysis of the model is carried out by the
singular perturbation technique in order to derive boundary conditions on the
system parameters which identify, in particular, the existence of limit cycles
in our model system consistent with the oscillatory patterns often observed in
clinical data. We then utilize a sinusoidal term to incorporate the temporal
absorption of glucose in order to study the responses in the patients under
ambulatory-fed conditions. A numerical investigation is carried out in this
case to construct a bifurcation diagram to identify the ranges of parametric
values for which chaotic behavior can be expected, leading to interesting
biological interpretations.
